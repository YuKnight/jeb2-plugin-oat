# Android OAT Plugin for JEB

This plugin extracts DEX files from compiled OAT files (ELF) that are used by the Android Runtime.

Supports OAT Versions 39 - 45.

This plugin is semi-deprecated. We recommend using other tools (vdexExtractor, lief, dextra, etc.) to extract DEX files from OAT.

Building from source: run the `build-xxx` script (make sure to adjust the version number beforehand).
